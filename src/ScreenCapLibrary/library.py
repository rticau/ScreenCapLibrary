class ScreenCapLibrary:
    """ Test Library for taking screenshots on the machine where tests are run.

    Note that successfully taking screenshots requires tests to be run with
    a physical or virtual display.

    = Usage =

    How screenshots are taken when using Python depends on the chosen format.
    There are several supported formats: PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF and WebP. If no format
    is specified the screenshots will have the PNG format.

    For taking screenshots the following modules are used:

    - [https://python-mss.readthedocs.io| mss ] a fast cross-platform module used for taking screenshots and saving
     them in PNG format.

    - [https://pillow.readthedocs.io | Pillow] used on top of ``mss`` in order to save the screenshots in JPG/JPEG/WebP format.

    - [http://pygtk.org/ | PyGTK] is an alternative to ``mss`` for taking screenshots when using VNC.


    For video recording, [https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python/blob/master/README.md | OpenCV-Python] is used and
    the output file is in WebM format.

    = Where screenshots are saved =

    By default screenshots are saved into the same directory where the Robot
    Framework log file is written. If no log is created, screenshots are
    saved into the directory where the XML output file is written.

    It is possible to specify a custom location for screenshots using
    ``screenshot_directory`` argument when `importing` the library and using
    `Set Screenshot Directory` keyword during execution. It is also possible
    to save screenshots using an absolute path.

    = Time format =

    All delays and time intervals can be given as numbers considered seconds
    (e.g. ``0.5`` or ``42``) or in Robot Framework's time syntax
    (e.g. ``1.5 seconds`` or ``1 min 30 s``). For more information about
    the time syntax see the
    [http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#time-format|Robot Framework User Guide].

    = Boolean arguments =

    Some keywords accept arguments that are handled as Boolean values true or
    false. If such an argument is given as a string, it is considered false if
    it is either an empty string or case-insensitively equal to ``false``,
    ``none`` or ``no``. Other strings are considered true regardless
    their value, and other argument types are tested using the same
    [http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing|rules
    as in Python].

    True examples:
    | `Take Partial Screenshot` | embed=True    | # Strings are generally true.    |
    | `Take Partial Screenshot` | embed=yes     | # Same as the above.             |
    | `Take Partial Screenshot` | embed=${TRUE} | # Python ``True`` is true.       |
    | `Take Partial Screenshot` | embed=${42}   | # Numbers other than 0 are true. |
    False examples:
    | `Take Partial Screenshot` | embed=False    | # String ``false`` is false.   |
    | `Take Partial Screenshot` | embed=no       | # Also string ``no`` is false. |
    | `Take Partial Screenshot` | embed=${EMPTY} | # Empty string is false.       |
    | `Take Partial Screenshot` | embed=${FALSE} | # Python ``False`` is false.   |

        """
        ``screenshot_module`` specifies the module or tool to use when taking screenshots using this library.
        If no tool or module is specified, ``mss`` will be used by default. For running
        on Linux with VNC, use ``PyGTK``.

        To configure where screenshots are saved use ``screenshot_directory``. If no value is given,
        screenshots are saved into same directory as the log file. The directory can also be set using
        `Set Screenshot Directory` keyword.

        ``format`` specifies the format in which the screenshots will be saved.
        Possible values are ``png``,  ``jpeg``, ``jpg`` and ``webp``, case-insensitively.
        If no value is given the format is set by default to ``png``.

        ``quality`` can take values in range [0, 100]. Value 0 is lowest quality,
        while value 100 is maximum quality. The quality is directly proportional
        with file size. Because PNG uses lossless compression its size
        may be larger than the size of the JPG file. The default value is 50.

        ``delay`` specifies the waiting time before taking a screenshot. See
        `Time format` section for more information. By default the delay is 0.

        Examples (use only one of these):
        | =Setting= |  =Value=   |  =Value=                        |

        Name of the file where the screenshot is stored is derived from the
        given ``name``. If the ``name`` ends with extension ``.jpg``, ``.jpeg``,
        ``.png`` or ``.webp``, the screenshot will be stored with that exact name.
        Otherwise a unique name is created by adding an underscore, a running
        index and an extension to the ``name``.

        The name will be interpreted to be relative to the directory where
        the log file is written. It is also possible to use absolute paths.
        Using ``/`` as a path separator works in all operating systems.

        ``format`` specifies the format in which the screenshot is saved. If
        no format is provided the library import value will be used which is

        case insensitive.

        ``quality`` can take values in range [0, 100]. In case of JPEG format
        it can drastically reduce the file size of the image.

        ``width`` specifies the size of the screenshot in the log file.

        ``delay`` specifies the waiting time before taking a screenshot. See
